# Horiseon Code Refactor 

## Challenge
Challenge 1 for Columbia's Coding Bootcamp is to refactor existing code to make it cleaner and more accessible. 

## User Story 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

- THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the image elements
- THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes
- THEN they fall in sequential order
